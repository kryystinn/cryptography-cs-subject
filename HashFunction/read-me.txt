Here it is given a program made with Java Swing. The code is divided in the interface part and the logic one. Here you can introduce an username and a password in the sign up window to register in the database, which automatically saves the data once pressed the button 'Sign up'.
Then, if you have an account you can go to the log in window. If you introduce correctly the username and the password it will show up a message saying that you are able to access your account, and if not the system will tell you that you do not have an account.
As well, if you try to sign up with an account that already exists, it will show up another message.
